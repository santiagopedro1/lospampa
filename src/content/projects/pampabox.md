## Overview

The National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) estimates that more than 7 million pirated TV Boxes are in use in Brazil, posing economic and security risks to users. To combat piracy, Anatel, together with the Federal Revenue Service and the Federal Police, invests in actions to block pirated signals and seize devices. Each year, hundreds of thousands of TV Boxes are seized and, instead of being destroyed, they are defaced in cooperation with universities. This process involves replacing pirated software with free software, transforming devices into legal and functional devices. Reusing these TV Boxes reduces electronic waste, saves public resources, promotes digital inclusion and reflects social responsibility by benefiting schools and community centers. Thus, the initiative combats piracy and generates multiple benefits for society.

## Key Features

- Installation of Linux-based operating systems for use in school environments.
- Creation of processing clusters using repurposed TV Box devices.
- Promotion of sustainability through the reuse of electronic devices.
- Provision of internet access and educational content in low-income communities.

## Challenges and Opportunities

- **Hardware Compatibility:** Ensuring that the software is compatible with a wide range of repurposed TV Box devices can be a significant technical challenge.
- **Security and Privacy:** Implementing robust security and privacy measures is crucial, especially when providing internet access in low-income communities.
- **Internet Access:** The availability and quality of internet access can vary in different regions, which may affect the project's effectiveness in some areas.
- **Community Engagement:** Maintaining community engagement and ensuring that the project meets the needs and expectations of users is key to its long-term success.
