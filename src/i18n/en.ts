	idk: "With the increase in demand for services made available through embedded systems (e.g., tablets and smartphones, automobiles, biomedical instruments) and the imminent growth of systems that provide interconnection between such devices (e.g., wireless networks, 4G, 5G, bluetooth technology) , there is a need for training professionals to work in the development of the area. In this sense, the group seeks to model and develop computational systems (e.g., methods and algorithms) that aim to optimize the solution of complex problems involving hardware and software components in the broad areas of embedded systems and computer networks. In particular, the group's work is very focused on the development of technologies and applications that have a strong possibility of appropriation by national companies in conjunction with the production of scientific work with national and international impact.",
