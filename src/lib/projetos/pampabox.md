## Overview

The main goal of PampaBox is to turn ordinary TVs into powerful educational tools, providing access to the internet, educational content, and advanced processing capabilities through the installation of Linux-based operating systems. Additionally, the project aims to create processing clusters using these repurposed devices to provide high processing capacity at low cost.

## Key Features

- Installation of Linux-based operating systems for use in school environments.
- Creation of processing clusters using repurposed TV Box devices.
- Promotion of sustainability through the reuse of electronic devices.
- Provision of internet access and educational content in low-income communities.

## Challenges and Opportunities

- **Hardware Compatibility:** Ensuring that the software is compatible with a wide range of repurposed TV Box devices can be a significant technical challenge.
- **Security and Privacy:** Implementing robust security and privacy measures is crucial, especially when providing internet access in low-income communities.
- **Internet Access:** The availability and quality of internet access can vary in different regions, which may affect the project's effectiveness in some areas.
- **Community Engagement:** Maintaining community engagement and ensuring that the project meets the needs and expectations of users is key to its long-term success.
